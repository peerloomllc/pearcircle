# Privileged Linux updater for the PearCircle seeder (proposal 2026-06-05-seeder
# -update slice 3c). Runs as ROOT via pkexec — the .deb postinst installs this
# script root-owned (0755) and a polkit rule that lets the seeder's own user run
# exactly this program without a password. The unprivileged host already
# downloaded + sha256-verified the .deb; this helper RE-verifies it before
# `dpkg -i`, so even though pkexec only authorizes *running* the script, a
# tampered/wrong .deb handed in cannot get installed.
#
# Trust anchor: HTTPS to GitHub + the release .sha256 (Linux .debs are unsigned),
# the same boundary the host enforced. The polkit rule is scoped to one user and
# this one absolute, root-owned program path, so it grants no general root.
#
# Usage (from the host's deb applier):
#   pkexec /opt/pearcircle-seeder/updater-helper.sh <debPath> <wantSha256> <user> <version>
