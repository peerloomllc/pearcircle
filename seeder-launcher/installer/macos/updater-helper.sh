# -update slice 3b). Runs as ROOT, started by the com.pearcircle.seeder.updater
# LaunchDaemon's WatchPaths when the unprivileged launcher drops an apply
# request. The launcher already downloaded + sha256-verified the .pkg; this
# helper RE-verifies it (sha256 + Developer-ID team + notarization) before
# running `installer`, so a malicious local drop cannot get an arbitrary pkg
# installed — only a PearCircle-signed, Apple-notarized package passes.
