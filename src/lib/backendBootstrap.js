// Process-level helpers for the shared backend bring-up that resumes the
// P2P worklet after a reboot or an in-place app update without an Activity
// (issue #89, proposal 2026-06-09 autostart on boot). Kept as a small pure
// module so the single-writer-critical start lock and the autostart-gate
// decision are unit-testable without pulling React Native into node-jest.
// app/index.tsx builds ensureBackendStarted() on top of makeStartLock and
// mirrors the sharing state into the native gate via autostartGateValue.

// Memoize an async bring-up so it runs at most once per process and every
// caller awaits the same promise. This is the load-bearing single-writer
// guard: a near-simultaneous Activity mount and headless boot task must not
// both pass the worklet's _workletStarted check and open the Autobase
// writer core twice (which corrupts the local view -- see DECISIONS
// 2026-05-29). The first caller starts the work; concurrent and later
// callers get the same in-flight (or settled) promise, so startFn's body
// runs exactly once.
//
// A rejected start is intentionally NOT cached: if the first attempt throws
// (e.g. bundle load failed), the next call re-runs startFn so a transient
// failure isn't permanent. A resolved start stays cached forever (the
// backend is up; re-calling is a no-op).

// Decide what to write into the native autostart gate from a worklet
// sharing-state payload. The boolean lives under a different field per

// Returns { write, value }: write=false means the payload didn't carry a
// usable boolean, so leave the gate untouched rather than clobbering it
// with a guess. When write=true, value is the boolean to mirror (true when
// sharing is on in at least one circle, including the zero-circles
// default-on case the worklet folds into the field for us).
